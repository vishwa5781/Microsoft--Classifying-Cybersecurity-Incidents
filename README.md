# **🚨Microsoft: Classifying Cybersecurity Incidents with Machine Learning🔐**

## **Project Overview**
The **Classifying Cybersecurity Incidents🚨** project is a machine learning-based solution designed to enhance the efficiency of **Security Operation Centers (SOCs)** at Microsoft. The project focuses on building a classification model that accurately predicts the triage grade of cybersecurity incidents, assisting SOC analysts in prioritizing their efforts and responding to threats efficiently.

The goal is to classify incidents as:
- **True Positive (TP)**: A confirmed threat.
- **Benign Positive (BP)**: A false alarm.
- **False Positive (FP)**: A misidentified threat.

## **Key Features & Skills**
This project allows you to dive deep into several crucial aspects of data science and machine learning:
- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**: Cleaning and transforming raw data into useful features for model training.
- **Machine Learning Classification Techniques**: Employing algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, and others for incident classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Using **Macro-F1 Score**, **Precision**, and **Recall** to assess model performance.
- **Cybersecurity Frameworks**: Leveraging the **MITRE ATT&CK** framework for better understanding of cybersecurity data.
- **Handling Imbalanced Datasets**: Implementing strategies like SMOTE, class weights, and ensemble methods to deal with imbalanced data.
- **Model Optimization**: Fine-tuning model parameters for optimal performance.

## **Business Use Cases**
The developed solution can significantly improve multiple areas of cybersecurity operations:
- **Security Operations Centers (SOCs)**: Automates the triage process and enhances analysts' decision-making.
- **Incident Response Automation**: Provides SOCs with faster, data-driven insights and recommended actions.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Increases the precision of detecting true and false positives using historical data.
- **Enterprise Security Management**: Reduces false positives, improves threat detection, and ensures swift incident response.

## **Project Approach**
### **1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing**
- **Initial Inspection**: Load and examine the train dataset (`train.csv`) to understand the structure, data types, and distribution of the target variable.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize patterns, identify correlations, and detect anomalies, particularly class imbalances.
  
### **2. Model Building**
- **Train-Validation Split**: Split the data into training and validation sets for effective model evaluation.
- **Baseline Model**: Start with simple models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) to set a performance benchmark.
- **Advanced Models**: Use Random Forest, XGBoost, and other sophisticated models for classification.
- **Cross-Validation**: Implement k-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness.

### **3. Model Evaluation**
- **Performance Metrics**: Focus on **Macro-F1 Score**, **Precision**, and **Recall** to measure the model’s ability to generalize to unseen data.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to optimize model performance.
- **Handling Class Imbalance**: Apply methods like **SMOTE** or adjust class weights to handle class imbalance.

### **4. Final Evaluation**
- **Testing**: Evaluate the final model using the test dataset (`test.csv`) and report key metrics.
- **Comparison to Baseline**: Ensure the model’s performance outperforms the baseline and holds up on unseen data.

## **Results**
- **Model Performance**: A highly accurate classification model that predicts cybersecurity incident triage grades (TP, BP, FP).
- **Feature Analysis**: Insights into which features influence model predictions the most.
- **Model Documentation**: Comprehensive process documentation, highlighting each phase from data collection to model evaluation.

## **Evaluation Metrics**
- **Macro-F1 Score**: Balances precision and recall, providing a holistic view of performance across all classes.
- **Precision**: Measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions.
- **Recall**: Measures the model’s ability to identify all true positives, ensuring critical incidents are not missed.

## **Dataset Overview**
The **GUIDE dataset** contains cybersecurity incident records annotated with triage grades (TP, BP, FP). The data is stratified and includes over **1 million** triage-annotated incidents, ensuring a comprehensive representation of real-world security incidents.

### **Features**:
- **Evidence**: Individual pieces of evidence like IP addresses, emails, and user details.
- **Alerts**: Aggregated evidence signaling a potential security incident.
- **Incidents**: A collection of alerts representing a complete security threat scenario.
